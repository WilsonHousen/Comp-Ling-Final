# Comp-Ling-Final
This is the README for Wilson Housen's Final Project 
for Computational Linguistics, CS366.

Included here are the features from the arff-writer, a copy of my final paper, 
and a copy of all the weka printouts from each testing run from both classifers. 
Both of those documents are in pdf form. 

This is the arff writer I used:
https://github.com/waltaskew/arff-writer
attached to which I wrote my own features for classification and used my choice 
of authors for the corpus.

The main bits would be my_features.py, which would be the python functions that
provided data that the classifiers used to differentiate the texts (given that
the features were decisive enough.)
